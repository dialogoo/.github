## LLMs as Communication Infrastructure

At **dialogoo**, we design and develop with the conviction that **Large Language Models (LLMs) are enablers of communication**â€”not endpoints, not actors, not companions.

> We see LLMs as **a new layer in the communication stack**:  
> a protocol, a medium, a wire that facilitates interaction between people, communities, entities, and information systems.

### At dialogoo, we:

- Use LLMs to **support and amplify human connection**, not to simulate it.
- Focus on **mediating conversations**, not replacing participants.
- Place **humans, communities, and cultures at the center** of every system.
- Design LLM-driven experiences to **augment coordination, creativity, and mutual understanding**.
- Treat LLMs as **transparent infrastructure**â€”interfaces to knowledge, tools for organization, and bridges between actors.

### At dialogoo, we don't:

- Build LLMs as artificial companions or social agents.
- Design systems where the model is the central voice or personality.
- Replace real relationships, community dynamics, or authorship with simulated interaction.

We are committed to exploring the role of LLMs in **creating new ways to connect**, while ensuring that **agency, ownership, and intention remain in human hands**.  
Our ambition is to build tools that are both technically sophisticated and socially groundedâ€”designed not to impress, but to empower.

#### [laiive](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive/tree/main) is the main project of DIALOGOO, however most of the services that are behind laiive are being built in a tranferable way, so they can be used by other projects to expand DIALOGOO values.
- [laiive_smm_agent](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive_SMM_agent) a vive coding experiment, if you want to try to touch the frankentein you are wellcome, but don't lose your time, it's precious.
- [scraper](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive/tree/main/services/scraper) data scraping engine until the wheel turns by itself.
- [data extractor](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive/tree/main/services/pusher) text to sql extractor with human validation workflows.
- [retriever](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive) a RAG-chat with laiive knowledge database
- [laiive UI](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive/tree/main/services/frontend) just a "Zero clic" frontend.
- [UDO Recocommendation System](https://github.com/dialogoo/UDO-Recomendation-System) UDO RS stands for user data ownership - Recomender System, this means that no black box will manipulate users, they know what they share, they can delete it, and change it at anytime.
