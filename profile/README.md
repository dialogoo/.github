## LLMs as Communication Infrastructure

At **dialogoo**, we design and develop with the conviction that **Large Language Models (LLMs) are enablers of communication**, not endpoints, not actors, not companions.

> We see LLMs as **a new layer in the communication stack**:  
> a protocol, a medium, a wire that facilitates interaction between people, communities, organizations, entities, and information systems.

### At dialogoo, we:

- Use LLMs to **support and amplify human connectity**, not to damage it.
- Focus on **mediating conversations**, not replacing participants.
- Place **humans, communities, and cultures at the center** of every system.
- Design LLM-driven experiences to **augment coordination, creativity, and mutual understanding**.
- Treat LLMs as **transparent infrastructure** that gives fast access to knowledge, bridges between actors, and enable powerfull tool building for the common good.

### At dialogoo, we don't:

- Build LLMs as artificial companions.
- Design systems where the model is the central voice.
- Replace real relationships, community dynamics, or authorship with simulated interaction.

We are committed to exploring the role of LLMs in **creating new ways to connect**, while ensuring that **agency, ownership, and intention remain in human hands**.  
Our ambition is to build tools that are both technically sophisticated and socially grounded—designed not to impress, but to empower.

#### [laiive](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive/tree/main) is the main project of DIALOGOO, however most of the services that are behind laiive are being built project agnostic, so they can be used by other projects to expand DIALOGOO values.
- [scraper](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive/tree/main/services/scraper) data scraping engine until the wheel turns by itself.
- parser
- [pusher](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive/tree/main/services/pusher) text to sql extractor with human validation workflows.
- [retriever](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive) a chat with laiive knowledge database.
- [laiive UI](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive/tree/main/services/frontend) just a "Zero clic" frontend.
- [laiive_smm_agent](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive_SMM_agent) a vive coding experiment, if you want to try to touch the frankentein you are wellcome, but don't lose your time, it's precious.
- [UDO Recocommendation System](https://github.com/dialogoo/UDO-Recomendation-System) UDO stands for user data ownership, this means that no black box will manipulate users, users are aware of what they share or privately use to feed the recomender system, they can delete it, and change it at anytime.
