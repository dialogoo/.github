## Applied AI Safety

Dialogoo was born as a natural response to digital unbalance. 
We are aware that the digital layer grows thicker every day, a digital intermediate layer is growing between human connections and the models or agents that are managing those connections are becoming increasingly powerful.

Some forecasts predict transformative AI within years, not decades, in this case we could be unprepared for the effects. 
We can’t wait for perfect research or policy.
The risk isn’t distant superintelligence, it has already started with the slow erosion of human agency happening right now.
We propose a fast action where physical and local networks are the safety net. 
#### At Dialogoo we ACT as a core value.

## Approach
We build with AI ethically.
Contribute to strengthening and urgently building a strong physical layer before AGI and digital unbalance create a critical combo.

### How?
We turn the algorithmic loop into a bridge toward real life by using AI contradictorily. AI is used to bring people back to people, pulling user from infinite scrolling into a face to face socialization. 
Returning data ownership to people and ensure its security to avoid deep manipulation. 

### What?
Applied projects.
Applied research, and analytics focused on policy change. 

### Why?
Because it is too risky to rely on a digital network where control could be kidnaped.
Because AI Safety begins where humans meet.

## Core Values
### At Dialogoo, we:
Use AI to reconnect, not to trap.
Understand physical networks and comunities as a resilience layer for a healthy system.
Keep humans, cultures, and communities at the center.

### We don’t:
Build artificial companions.
Optimize for engagement or addiction.
Replace real relationships with simulation.
Sell people's lives and intimacies in any data format.
We build tools for balance, not distraction.

## Join Us
Dialogoo is an open umbrella for those who act.
Builders. Researchers. Artists. Educators...
Anyone who believes AI Safety needs to move quick. 

## What’s Next
A white paper is in progress,to ground these ideas in data, research, and methodology.
Until then: prototype, connect, and share.
The work is urgent. The invitation is open.

[laiive](https://github.com/dialogoo/laiive/tree/main) is the fisrt project under the DIALOGOO umbrella, and some of the services that are behind laiive are being built project agnostic, so they can be used by other projects to expand DIALOGOO values.

[UDO Recocommendation System](https://github.com/dialogoo/UDO-Recomendation-System) UDO stands for user data ownership, this means that no black box will manipulate users, users are aware of what they share or privately use to feed the recomender system, they can delete it, and change it at anytime.
