## Core Principles

At dialogoo, we:

- Build with **people, communities, and cultures at the center**.
- Use LLMs as **infrastructure**, not personalities or replacements.
- Respect **user agency and data ownership**.
- Value **clear communication**, transparency, and thoughtful iteration.

If this resonates with you, you're in the right place.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dialogoo/your-target-repo.git
cd your-target-repo
```

### 2. Set Up
Each project will have its own README.md with setup instructions.
Please follow the stack requirements and run locally before submitting changes.

### 3. Make Changes
Comment your code clearly.

Follow existing file structure and naming conventions.

Document any new scripts, routes, or workflows.

### 4. Commit & Push
Use clear, conventional commit messages (e.g., feat: add n8n publishing node, fix: OAuth redirect bug).

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-name
git commit -m "feat: describe your feature"
git push origin your-feature-name
```

### 5. Open a Pull Request
Describe the why behind your change.
If it's experimental, note it. If it's core to the project, explain how it aligns with dialogooâ€™s values.

### 6. Commit Message Guidelines
Not a must, but a good practice that soon or later you should apply ->> follow the [Angular commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)
