## dialogoo: LLMs as Communication Infrastructure

At **dialogoo**, we design and develop with the conviction that **Large Language Models (LLMs) are enablers of communication**—not endpoints, not actors, not companions.

> We see LLMs as **a new layer in the communication stack**:  
> a protocol, a medium, a wire that facilitates interaction between people, communities, entities, and information systems.

### At dialogoo, we:

- Use LLMs to **support and amplify human connection**, not to simulate it.
- Focus on **mediating conversations**, not replacing participants.
- Place **humans, communities, and cultures at the center** of every system.
- Design LLM-driven experiences to **augment coordination, creativity, and mutual understanding**.
- Treat LLMs as **transparent infrastructure**—interfaces to knowledge, tools for organization, and bridges between actors.

### At dialogoo, we don't:

- Build LLMs as artificial companions or social agents.
- Design systems where the model is the central voice or personality.
- Replace real relationships, community dynamics, or authorship with simulated interaction.

We are committed to exploring the role of LLMs in **creating new ways to connect**, while ensuring that **agency, ownership, and intention remain in human hands**.  
Our ambition is to build tools that are both technically sophisticated and socially grounded—designed not to impress, but to empower.
